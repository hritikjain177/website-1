I am a Project Scientist at the `Berkeley Center for Cosmological
Physics`_ and a Data Science Fellow at the `Berkeley Institute for
Data Science`_ at UC Berkeley.

In part of my job, I study cosmology using Type Ia supernovae as part
of the `Nearby Supernova Factory`_, an experiment designed to study
nearby Type Ia supernovae in depth in order to enhance their use for
cosmology.  In the other part of my job, I write and maintain
open-source scientific software (primarily for astronomy research) and
investigate ways to make it easier for scientists to use programming
tools to accomplish their research.

Previously, I was a postdoc at `Argonne National Lab`_, in the High
Energy Physics division. I did my PhD at `UC Berkeley`_ with Saul
Perlmutter as part of the `Supernova Cosmology Project`_.

Very occasionally, I write up some of my explorations in open-source
scientific software in the `blog </blog>`_ section of this site.
