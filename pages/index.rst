I am currently a Cosmology Data Science Fellow at `Berkeley Center for
Cosmological Physics`_. I study cosmology using Type Ia supernovae as
part of the `Nearby Supernova Factory`_ (SNfactory) and the `Dark
Energy Survey`_ (DES). SNfactory is an experiment designed to study
nearby Type Ia supernovae in depth in order to enhance their use for
cosmology. DES is a five-year imaging program on a telescope in Chile,
designed to measure Dark Energy with unprecedented precision.

Previously, I was a postdoc at `Argonne National Lab`_, in the High
Energy Physics division. I did my PhD at `UC Berkeley`_ with Saul
Perlmutter as part of the `Supernova Cosmology Project`_.

One of my main interests is in open-source scientific software and
how to make it easier for scientists to discover, use and contribute to it.
See `software </software>`_ for some open-source projects I'm involved with.

Occasionally, I write up some of my explorations in open-source scientific
software in the `blog </blog>`_ section of this site.
