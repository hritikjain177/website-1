I am currently a postdoc at `Argonne National Lab`_, in the High
Energy Physics division. I study cosmology using Type Ia supernovae as
part of the `Dark Energy Survey`_ (DES). DES is a five-year imaging
program on a telescope in Chile, designed to measure Dark Energy with
unprecedented precision.

I did my PhD at `UC Berkeley`_ with Saul Perlmutter as part of the 
`Supernova Cosmology Project`_.

One of my main interests is in open-source scientific software and
how to make it easier for scientists to discover, use and contribute to it.
See `software </software>`_ for some open-source projects I'm involved with.

In May 2014 I will be starting a joint position at the `Berkeley
Center for Cosmological Physics`_ and the new `Berkeley Institute for
Data Science`_.

I am writing up some of my explorations in open-source scientific
software on my `blog </blog>`_.
