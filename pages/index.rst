I am a Project Scientist at the `Berkeley Center for Cosmological
Physics`_ and a Data Science Fellow at the `Berkeley Institute for
Data Science`_ at UC Berkeley. In part of my job, I study cosmology
using Type Ia supernovae as part of the `Nearby Supernova Factory`_
(SNfactory) SNfactory is an experiment designed to study nearby Type
Ia supernovae in depth in order to enhance their use for cosmology.

Previously, I was a postdoc at `Argonne National Lab`_, in the High
Energy Physics division. I did my PhD at `UC Berkeley`_ with Saul
Perlmutter as part of the `Supernova Cosmology Project`_.

One of my main interests is in open-source scientific software and
how to make it easier for scientists to discover, use and contribute to it.
See `software </software>`_ for some open-source projects I'm involved with.

Very occasionally, I write up some of my explorations in open-source scientific
software in the `blog </blog>`_ section of this site.
