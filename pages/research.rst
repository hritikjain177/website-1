Type Ia Supernova Cosmology
---------------------------

As a cosmologist I study the "Universe at large": how the Universe has
expanded over time and the properties of Dark Energy, its largest
component.  I do this using Type Ia supernovae, a type of stellar
explosion that can be used as an indicator of distance. These distance
indicators allow us to measure how the universe has expanded over the
past 10 billion years - looking back to the first third of the
universe's existence!

I'm currently involved in two separate supernova experiments: the
Nearby Supernova Factory (SNfactory) and the `Dark Energy Survey`_
(DES). SNfactory is an experiment on a telescope in Hawaii, and is
designed to study nearby Type Ia supernovae in great detail in order
to enhance their use in cosmology. DES is a five-year imaging program
on a telescope in Chile, designed to discover distant supernovae and
to measure Dark Energy with unprecedented precision.


High-redshift Type Ia Supernovae and their rates

My graduate work was done with the Saul Perlmutter and the Supernova
Cosmology Project at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. My thesis work
was on the HST Cluster Supernova Survey, a search for supernovae in
the most distant known galaxy clusters.  An overview of the survey was
presented in Dawson et al. (2009) and cosmology results from the
survey were presented in Suzuki et al. (2012). See the `HST Cluster
Survey website`_ for more details on the survey.

My thesis focused on Type Ia supernova rates, particularly in galaxy
clusters. In Barbary et al. (2012a) we published the highest-redshift
cluster SN rate measurement, using it to constrain the SN Ia
progenitor scenario via the delay time distribution.

In Barbary et al. (2012b) we presented the volumetric SN Ia rate from
the survey, adding signifcantly to rate statistics at redshifts of 1
and above.

My thesis is available as a `PDF`_.

The Superluminous Supernova SCP06F6
-----------------------------------

I published the discovery of the very unusual transient SCP06F6 in
Barbary et al. (2009). Discovered during the course of the HST Cluster
Supernova Survey, SCP06F6 has become a prototype event for a new class
of superluminous supernovae (Pastorello et al. 2010; Quimby et
al. 2011).
