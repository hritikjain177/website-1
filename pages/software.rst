These are some of the open-source projects I contribute to:

====

`AstroPy`_
----------

AstroPy is a community-developed Python library for astronomy.  A lot
of my work on the core package has been on the documentation,
including the layout, style and logo. I also contributed some
functions in the ``stats`` module. `AstroPy on GitHub`_.

====

`PhotUtils`_
------------

PhotUtils is an AstroPy affiliated package for photometry in Python,
destined for eventual inclusion in the main package as
``astropy.photometry``. As opposted to a tool like Source Extractor,
it is aimed at easily customizable high-precision photometry of a
small number of sources. I wrote the existing implementation of
aperture photometry. Work on PSF photometry is ongoing. `PhotUtils on
GitHub`_.

====

`SNCosmo`_
----------

SNCosmo is an AstroPy-based Python package for supernova cosmology. 
It's what I spend most of my time on these days. `SNCosmo on GitHub`_.

Other Projects
--------------

* `paper-tools`_ contains scripts for preparing papers for
  astronomical journals.

* `nestpy`_ is an implementation of the multimodal nested
  sampling algorithm for evaluating Bayesian evidence that I am
  currently working on.
